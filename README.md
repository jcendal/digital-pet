  <h1>Digital Pet</h1>
  <p>A Digimon virtual pet that evolves with AI token usage in Cursor and OpenCode, with a local web companion.</p>
</div>

Digital Pet has a Cursor extension, an OpenCode plugin, and a local web companion. They read the same SQLite database, so your partner, Dex discoveries, and generation history carry across the three views. Cursor and OpenCode record token usage; the web companion displays the shared progress.

## Choose your app

| App | What it does | Get started |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Cursor Digital Pet](packages/cursor-digital-pet/README.md) | Shows your partner in the Explorer sidebar and tracks Cursor Agent usage through hooks, with an API fallback. | [Install from Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/jcendal/cursor-digital-pet) or use a VSIX from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jcendal/digital-pet/releases). Follow the [Cursor setup guide](packages/cursor-digital-pet/README.md#-usage) to install hooks and hatch a partner. |
| [OpenCode Digital Pet](packages/opencode-digital-pet/README.md) | Adds a TUI sidebar and `/digital-pet-*` commands; completed assistant messages provide experience. | Run `npx @jcendal/opencode-digital-pet init`, restart OpenCode, then run `/digital-pet-spawn`. See the [OpenCode guide](packages/opencode-digital-pet/README.md#quick-start). |
| [Web Digital Pet](packages/web-digital-pet/README.md) | Shows the animated partner, Digidex, and generation history in a phone-width browser layout. | Run `npm run web`, then open `http://localhost:4173`. |

The [illustrative OpenCode preview](_images/digital-pet-overview.png) shows the partner, Dex, and history views. Each app's README describes its own commands, requirements, settings, and storage behavior.

## Shared progress and migration

All three apps resolve the same `pet.db` location by default:

| Platform | Database |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/opencode-digital-pet/pet.db` |
| Linux / WSL | `~/.local/share/opencode-digital-pet/pet.db` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\opencode-digital-pet\pet.db` |

If the new database does not exist but an older `opencode-vpet/pet.db` does, both apps continue using that older database. OpenCode also continues reading an older `opencode-vpet.json` settings file until a new `opencode-digital-pet.json` is created.

If you previously installed `@sbugallo/opencode-vpet` or unscoped `opencode-vpet`, remove its OpenCode registration to avoid loading both plugins. The [OpenCode guide](packages/opencode-digital-pet/README.md#update) has the update command; the [Cursor guide](packages/cursor-digital-pet/README.md#-storage) covers its database override.

## Repository layout

| Workspace | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/cursor-digital-pet`](packages/cursor-digital-pet) | Cursor extension, packaged as a VSIX |
| [`packages/opencode-digital-pet`](packages/opencode-digital-pet) | `@jcendal/opencode-digital-pet`, npm plugin and CLI |
| [`packages/digital-pet-core`](packages/digital-pet-core) | Shared catalog, evolution rules, use cases, and SQLite schema; private workspace |
| [`packages/digital-pet-animation`](packages/digital-pet-animation) | Shared animation logic; private workspace |
| [`packages/digital-pet-webviews`](packages/digital-pet-webviews) | Shared browser interface for Cursor and the web companion; private workspace |
| [`packages/web-digital-pet`](packages/web-digital-pet) | Local browser server and read-only SQLite adapter |

The root workspace is private. The shared packages are bundled into the products and are not published separately. Cursor and OpenCode have [separate changelogs](CHANGELOG.md) and release versions. See [monorepo documentation](docs/monorepo.md) for development tools and release details.

## Development

Use Node `24.11.0`, npm `11.6.1`, and Bun `1.3.5` (the versions declared by the workspace). npm installs dependencies and runs workspace scripts; Bun runs the tests and the OpenCode plugin at runtime. Builds use Node and esbuild.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm run test
npm run test:persistence
npm run build
```

To create local distributables:

```sh
npm run pack:opencode
npm run package --workspace cursor-digital-pet
```

Contributions and issues belong in the [repository](https://github.com/jcendal/digital-pet). The two product READMEs provide their user guides; [docs/monorepo.md](docs/monorepo.md) lists package-specific development commands.
